# DeSci Tokenomics

This research focus on understanding and developing fundamental theory and models to understand the tokenomics of Decentralized Science (DeSci) platform taking ResearchHub's ResearchCoin (RSC) as use case. 

More details will be updatated here. 




## Executive Summary 

This section will summarize and highlight the overall status of tokenomics literature, along with framework toward modelling them

### Introduction 
A bit of general introduction into Tokenomics and DeSci Tokenomics and what general feature that could be different

### Theory

Include existing models and known parameter for this modelling 
Include coverage of glossary here 
Vesting, Distribution, Emission, and so on should be carefully defined here.



### Marketplace 

Specific to the marketplace dynamics of on-platform and off-platform

### Other concepts 

all other relevant concept to cover and discuss

## Modelling Tools 

In addition to performing literature review and analysis, we also develop specific simulation model and dashboard specifically for designing tokenomics of DeSci or research focused platform. 
This will be a great addition to the research suite where community member could perform various experimentation and observation using the modelled tools and try to devise insights and understanding from the tokenomics system. 
We will share the dashboard for this in a separate demo module.
