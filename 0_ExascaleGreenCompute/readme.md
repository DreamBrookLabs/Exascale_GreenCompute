The acceleration of demand for computing power to fulfil our civilization has been on-track to exceed the exascale--at least one exaflop, or a (10^18) calculations per second. Alongside with this enormous increase of computation demand, the burden of ensuring green energy usage and low carbon emission has become a great challenge and concern for the development of exascale computing. In this study we proposed a big-data survey and technoeconomic analysis to probe ways and areas in which the green energy can be addressed while at the same time reducing cost and maximizing safety and stability of performance for the computation facility. To this end, we will focus our data survey to set the stage toward understanding the need of exascale green computing toward next-generation smart city powered by artificial intelligence and beyond. 

The study will produce a complex high-quality dataset that provide detailed technology tree toward for various scenarios, along with data that support the assessment of technology readiness level (TRL) for each technology component involved.  We will also design an architecture blueprint based on the gathered data and insights as a form of realistic modelling of the possible scenario involving real city under development. As a specific case-study, we consider the Nusantara Capital City (Indonesia’s New Capital, focusing on Green Sustainable Development) as an anchor for real-world geographic and socioeconomic context in developing the model system.  We expect the project to take less than 1 year to complete, and continuous progress in the form of open-dataset and organic documentations will be shared and updated periodically. We foresee the need and importance of this study will become apparent in due time, and will be critical to ensure sustainability and scalability of our Smart Cities.
