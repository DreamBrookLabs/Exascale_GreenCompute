Big-Data Driven Life Cycle Analysis and Environmental Impact Tracing of Core New Energy Minerals (Li, Ni, Co) toward on Blockchain Carbon Accounting and Trading

## 1. Project Overview 

In the global trend of energy transition and carbon neutrality, the development of new energy technologies and industries heavily depends on several critical mineral resources. However, the entire supply chain, from mining to finished products, inevitably brings environmental pollution, carbon emissions, and social impacts. 
This project leverages big data and blockchain encryption technology to create a transaction system cloud platform based on carbon emission trading between companies. It conducts an in-depth analysis of rare earth production in Inner Mongolia, linking it to carbon emissions and tracking its environmental impact. The aim is to provide a clear environmental impact assessment, promote the conservation and utilization of mineral resources in China, and enhance public awareness of mineral resources and environmental protection.

## 2. Research Objectives

The project aims to use big data and blockchain encryption technology to build an innovative carbon emission trading system cloud platform. Through this platform, we will conduct an in-depth analysis of rare earth production in Inner Mongolia, link it with carbon emissions, and track its environmental impact throughout the supply chain. The core goal of the project is to provide a clear environmental impact assessment, which will help companies better understand and manage their environmental responsibilities in the process of mining and using mineral resources, and promote the conservation and efficient utilization of mineral resources in China.

## 3. Research Content

This project focuses on the production data of rare earth elements in Inner Mongolia and carbon emission data. It builds a carbon emission trading system platform based on big data and blockchain encryption technology to facilitate carbon emission trading activities among mining companies, meeting the needs of companies for carbon emissions and the carbon trading market.

## 4. Current Research Status and Development Trends

Domestically, big data has been widely used in data collection and analysis in the extraction, processing, and use of new energy minerals. By collecting massive environmental data and combining it with advanced algorithms, it is possible to achieve precise monitoring and evaluation of the full life cycle of new energy minerals. Meanwhile, the application of blockchain technology in China continues to expand, particularly in the areas of agricultural product traceability, food safety, and drug regulation, achieving significant results. The Chinese government attaches great importance to the development of blockchain technology, considering it a key industry in the digital economy. Major domestic internet companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu have established blockchain laboratories, investing in research and exploring the commercial applications of blockchain technology. China's carbon market construction has also developed rapidly. Since 2011, China has established eight pilot carbon markets and launched a national carbon market on July 16, 2021. By the end of 2023, the national carbon market's cumulative transaction volume reached 442 million tons, with a cumulative transaction value of approximately 24.9 billion yuan, covering about 5.1 billion tons of CO2 emissions and including 2,257 key emitting units, making it the largest carbon market in the world by coverage of greenhouse gas emissions.

Internationally, big data technology is similarly used to trace the environmental impacts of new energy minerals. Through big data analysis, it is possible to predict and evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the extraction and use of new energy minerals, providing a scientific basis for policy-making. Developed countries such as the United States, Europe, and Japan lead the research on blockchain technology. Many large technology companies and startups have made significant breakthroughs in the field of blockchain. Globally, blockchain technology has been widely applied in multiple fields such as product traceability, finance, and government affairs. As of January 2023, there were 28 effective carbon trading systems worldwide, with more than 20 under development or design. Carbon markets cover approximately 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions, one-third of the population, and 55% of GDP.

## 5. Innovations and Project Features

This project utilizes big data and blockchain encryption technology to build an innovative carbon emission trading system cloud platform. Through the constructed cloud platform, it also conducts an in-depth analysis of rare earth production in Inner Mongolia, linking it with carbon emissions, and tracking its environmental impact throughout the supply chain. Big data technology is used to comprehensively analyze the production and carbon emission data of rare earth elements, providing accurate carbon emission calculations and predictions. Data mining identifies the main sources and trends of carbon emissions, helping companies formulate more effective emission reduction strategies. Blockchain technology ensures the transparency and immutability of carbon emission data, enhancing the credibility and security of the data. Automated transactions through smart contracts reduce human intervention, improving the efficiency and fairness of transactions.
